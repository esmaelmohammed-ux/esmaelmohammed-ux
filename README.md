Animated README tips
- The SVG at the top is live and self-contained — you can edit colors, text, and animation timings directly in this file.
- If you want richer animations, consider adding animated GIF demos of apps (host them in /assets or use GitHub releases to store media).
- Use GitHub Actions to automatically update stats or an animated GIF (e.g., record a short demo and push to the README on release).

Quick copy-paste templates

- Project card template:
```md


```

- Contact badge (example):
```md

```

If you'd like, I can:
- customize the SVG hero's colors and animation to match your personal brand,
- generate ready-to-use project cards for your top 3 repos,
- and produce a small animated demo GIF template you can run locally and embed.

Would you like me to customize the header colors and create project cards from your GitHub repos?
